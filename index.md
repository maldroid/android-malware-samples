# Not so boring Android malware

Welcome! The purpose of this website is to gather a diverse set of different Android malware samples. So often the Android malware datasets are boring. They have the same or very similar malware families and, if used to practice reverse engineering, may become very repetitive.

I've decided to create a list of samples which are different. Each one should give you a different, fun reverse engineering challenge. The samples are divded in three sections: easy, average and difficult. Each one contans a short description of what the malware does. All samples are sourced from publicly available websites and link to these websites.

*Have fun!*
